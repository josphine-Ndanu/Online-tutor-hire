        <h1>SERVICES WE OFFER</h1>
        <P>Once you hire one of our tutors we will be helping you with the following service either in <strong>Personal</strong> or <strong>Virtually</strong>
        Tutoring services play a key role in the overall success of any college or university, not just the overall success of the students being tutored. The mission for any tutoring service is to ensure academic excellence for the whole of the student body by providing a place, assistance, group of people, and/or the right resources to encourage pupils to seek help when and where the need it. Tutoring is not a replacement for what can be learned in the classroom or from a professor or teacher. However, it is a strong resource for learning that works closely with and alongside what happens in the classroom and in home study.</P>
